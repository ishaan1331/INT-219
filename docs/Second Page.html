            How to be a chivalric towards a woman
        </h1>
        <p class="top-para">Have you ever questioned yourself what real romance is ? Or how can you show your effort and care towards your partner/wife ? Is it just about what they show in movies or social media ? Like going on expensive trips , staying in luxurious hotels
            , going shopping and all that money related stuff ? If you're thinking that yes , then I'm sorry , you're wrong . Romance is not about throwing money . Money may , and infact does , buys happiness but it doesn't buy you love and romance .
            It is something that comes from you yourself . It is not something to be asked about , no girl will ever frequently say to you about being romantic , but she does expect it from you . It's not about buying gifts everytime you go out and return
            , or any rich surprises . It includes that , I'm not saying that these things are totally distant , but gifts , trips , money and all is just a small subset . The real charm which most of the relationships are lacking nowadays is due to lack
            of chivalry in men . Chivalry refers to general courteous and noble behaviour of men towards women to show respect , compassion , trust and morality .Like , for example , calling your girl a queen , and treating her like a queen , are two
            very different things . Many women consider chivalry as something like a lost art nowadays . So , if you want to have a sweet charm in your relationship or gain some respect among women , and you want them to like you , you have to follow
            a certain code of conduct . This thing really shows what kind of person you actually are . Some of the very basic rules to be a chivalric , romantic and better man are given as follows :
        </p>

        <div class="content">
            <!-- Ladies first -->

            <h1>1. Always remember ladies first rule </h1>
            <p>
                Always remember wherever you are , ladies first rule is necessary . But yes , only for your girl. Like for example , if you are in a public transport and there is only one vacant seat left , then it is your duty to offer that seat to your partner, or
                the girl you are with . But yes , remember , don't do it for every woman unless she is disabled , aged , pregnant or has a baby with her . But if some female is travelling with you , it's your duty to make her have a seat first .
                <img class="alignment  " src="Images2/ladies first.jpg" alt="">
            </p>

            <!-- Materialism and Romance -->

            <h1>2. Romance doesn't need to be always materialistic</h1>
            <p>
                Romance isn't only about gifts and surprises . I am not saying don't bring these , do buy her flowers , jhanjaras , earrings , gajras etc. These things may be inexpensive , but the aura and the feelings these things carry are really the richest in the
                world , they can't be purchased from buying jwellery and exotic perfumes . But , one more thing: These things are good to be bought occasionaly . There is no use of bringing flowers daily , but it would be excellent if you bring them after
                you get a promotion . Apart from these gifts , try some other romantic things , like little tango in the bedroom and kitchen , handling / giving her your hoodies and jackets when it is cold or raining , and always holding the umbrella
                in case you both nee to in case of rain , little bit of teasing and mocking , eye contact and there are a lot more little things in life that do matter and tell a lot about you .
                <img class="alignment  " src="Images2/material.jpg" alt="">
            </p>

            <!-- Opening Car Doors -->

            <h1>3. Always open car doors for her</h1>
            <p>
                This is a very important and basic rule of chivalry . No matter whatever is the position of the girl is or whatever is her status or whatever bond or relation she shares with you , you always have to open the car doors for her first , then also gently
                close them afterwards and then you have to take the seat yourself . Never take a seat before her whether you're in a public transport , restaurant or any other place . Do the same while getting off the car . Get off first , then open the
                door , hold her hand and take her out .Impress your girl like this the next time you go for a dinner !!
                <br>
                <img class="alignment  " src="Images2/car door.jpg" alt="">
            </p>

            <!-- Standing and Greeting -->

            <h1>4. Standing and Greeting</h1>
            <p>
                Many a times in your dating or professional life , there will be instances that you would have to meet a lady/girl in a restaurant or a public place . You don't have to go and take her , as it will cost you seat (LOL) , but you have to stand up from your
                place and greet them , again , irrespective of her qualifications and relations .<br>
                <img class="alignment  " src="Images2/greet.jpg" alt="">
            </p>

            <!-- Walking in left -->
            <h1>5. Making her walk in front</h1>
            <p>
                Whenever you are going either to any party , or any meeting , or any family get together , shopping in a mall , or whatever else you are doing which would need you walking , your girl should walk about one to two steps ahead of you and should preferably
                be to your left . You should never ever walk leaving her behind , no matter how important guest you see . This thing indicates that you like to show off your girl and respect just her presence . Its icing on the cake if walk is synced
                and you are holding hands. <br>
                <img class="alignment  " src="Images2/walking.jpg" alt="">
            </p>

            <!-- Table Ettiquettes -->
            <h1>6. Table Ettiquettes</h1>
            <p>
                It doesn't matter with whoever or with how many people you are dining , you always have to follow table ettiquettes . Whenever the food comes , always serve it on other person's plate first . It is not necessary for you to serve them you can either wait
                for someone to serve too . Also , never take a seat or start eating before her and do pull the chair , but only if you're in a pair .
                <br>
                <img class="alignment  " src="Images2/foodetiquette.jpg" alt="">
            </p>

            <!-- Closing doors -->
            <h1>7. Never Close door on her face </h1>
            <p> This is a rule which is ignored most of the times . Actually , you should not have a girl behind you in first place but just in case ; there is a girl behind you , you should never slam or close a door against her face . This behaviour is
                considered very rude , disrespectful and uncivil . If you do it by mistake , then instantaneoulsy apologize , but the best thing would be to avoid this by either holding the door for her , or the best solution - let her be in front from
                the first place .
                <img class="alignment  " src="Images2/door.jpg" alt="">

                <br>
            </p>

            <!-- Helping hand -->
            <h1>8. Giving a helping hand</h1>
            <p>
                Don't ever consider anything specified by gender roles , like washing dishes , cooking , laundry etc. Help her in these small daily chores whenever you are able to , so that you can finish them together and have extra free time for each other , and do
                help extra during day offs .
                <br>
                <img class="alignment  " src="Images2/household.jpg" alt="">
            </p>

            <!-- Disrespect -->
            <h1>9. Never be disrespectful</h1>
            <p>
                Girls love guys who treat her parents good and never disrespect her . No matter in how much heated argument you are , never ever disrespect a girl or say anything that would hurt her in an unimaginable way . And yes , never disrespect her parents , but
                treat them like your own . Small arguments are healthy in a small amount , no worries , but never bring her family in the middle of it . Even if you're out of you mind or under the influence of world's strongest drug , don't ever do it
                .
                <br>
                <img class="alignment  " src="Images2/fight.jpg" alt="">

            </p>

            <!--Complimentation -->
            <h1>10. Always compliment her</h1>
            <p>
                Never forget to compilment your girl . Even small compliments like - " The food is fantastic ! " or " You're looking good " will make her day . Even though she is permanently yours , flirt with her like you're still trying to get her . Then just wait
                for the magic to happen and see how your life turns .<br>
                <img class="alignment  " src="Images2/compliment.jpg" alt="">

            </p>

            <!-- Important Dates -->
            <h1>11. Remember Important Dates</h1>
            <p>
                Do remember important dates like the first date day , birthday , engagement day , marriage anniversary day and sometimes the places like where you met first time and all . Most people suck at remembering dates and places and this is where you have to
                grab the chance . You can host small suprise parties ,or even big ones on these days . Like for example , one of the best plans is to completely act like you know nothing or literally just don't care at all about these occassions and at
                the end , throw a big suprised planned party . The smile at the end would be worth it . <br>
                <img class="alignment  " src="Images2/surprise.jpg" alt="">

            </p>

            <!-- Small Dates -->
            <h1>12. Go on small dates</h1>
            <p>
                Dates not necessarily need to be at restaurants or movies . You can go for a walk on the beach , have some snacks at the stall , purchase groceries together , have streetfood together , stargaze , have some cute conversations and there is a lot more stuff
                to do together which would be better if done together . It will also deepen the relationship and you will get to understand each other more .
                <img class="alignment  " src="Images2/small date.jpg" alt="">

        <p class="top-para">
            At last , this is the main rule to follow , after you get to apply all these rules . Don't make these things seem very formal or just like you are doing them as a favour . You are doing these because you are a gentleman , and you want your woman to be
            happy . It should be something coming from you inside , it should not feel like you're being coaxed to do it . Some of these may be difficult to follow at first , as you may forget about them depending on the situation , but with dedication
            , time and practice , these etiquettes will become your daily habit .
