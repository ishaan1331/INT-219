            How to become rich
        </h1>

        <p class="top-para">
            They say that money is solution to 95% of all life problems , and yes , why this statement can be false ? Everyone needs money to fulfill their wishes and run a smooth lifestyle .Who doesn't want to go to exotic vacations , stay in a luxury hotel instead
            of lodges , have a big fancy car , purchase whatever they want to and so more . We all have that one dress in our wishlist that we are unable to purchase , and most of the middle class people face this problem day to day , like for example
            , assume that you and your friends go to a mall for shopping, you just saw something and like that thing too much , but you put it back after looking at the price tag . Your friends start insisiting you to purchase that goddamn thing but you
            are unable to take money from any of them just because you will need a plenty of time to repay that debt , orfear of making that a habit . You just change the topic and go to other section . This situationis really disheartening , but also
            pretty common . So , below here are some ways to get rich, or earn more money than the present , and how to sustain it for longer .

        <div class="content">
            <!-- Ladies first -->

            <h1>1. Learn investing and taking risks </h1>
            <p>
                Learn about stock markets , trading , cryptocurrency , the things that these things are dependent on , how does the price of a stock increase , and a whole lot of other things rather than blindly following you friend's advice . Invest a little part of
                your income first in the learning stage , and you will automatically start getting better with experience and learning .But yes , for this , you need to have patience and money saving skills . You can also look up at other things like
                investing in gold or mutual funds if you prefer long term returns . Who knows you may start investing in real estate after a few years !!<br>

            </p>

            <!-- Assets -->

            <h1>2. Focus on increasing assets rather than liabilities</h1>
            <p>
                Focus on things that increase your source of income rather than ones which will require maintenance . For example , what is the logic of buying a new car in first few years of employement ? If you need a vehicle for transportation , just purchase a second
                hand motorbike , or a cheap one motorbike with greater mileage rather than fancy motorbike with less mileage and more maintenance .Same can be done with cars too . Instead of buying cars , take one for lease during your first years or
                else just take a second hand one . A lot of money can be save by doing these things , which can even be further increased by buying more assets like stocks , plots etc.<br>

            <!-- Opening Car Doors -->

            <h1>3. Do your current job well</h1>
            <p>
                We don't need to quit our job and just start trading or statrtups without any former experience or knowledge . We can also be focused on our job and work on getting promotions and increments instead of just hating it and being like a crybaby . Work extra
                time occasionaly or whenever possible , keep good relations with your coworkers and boss and just be consisent at it to get a raise .

            <!-- Rental -->

            <h1>4. Rent out your things</h1>
            <p> Don't be too much attached to your belongings .If you have a home with some extra room , you can rent it out to earn a good passive income . Instead of keeping a car , you can rent one to cab companies . Building these types of assets may
                take a heavy investment , but there are much better returns over a long period of time . You may start with one room and then get them up to two , three and so on .

            <!-- Sell course -->
            <h1>5. Make a course on Udemy</h1>
            <p>If you are extraordinary at some skill , then you can partime coach about it or make a course about it in udemy . While , you can also try freelancing to earn some extra money . But yes ,don't forget the most important step , which is to be
                financially literate .
